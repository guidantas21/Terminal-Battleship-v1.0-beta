# Terminal Battleship v1.0

## Project Overview

1. ### Concept
- This game was inspired by a scene of the movie [Battleship](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440129/), in wich the characters have to predict where the enemy will move and attack before he gets there, in order to hit him. So, I thought that maybe it could be fun to program a little game with a similar concept. Basically, you are a ship in a battle with an enemy, but this enemy is not an normal ship, it's way faster and more agile, this way you have to shoot the position that you think the enemy will move to. But, there's a catch: you have limited shots, once run out of shots there's defense against the enemy and you lose, also if it reaches your position, it's gameover. It's important to notice that the enemy always knows where the your ship is, so it's more likely to move in your direction, even if in an unpredictable way. 


2. ### Technology
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) was my language of choice for its conveniece and practicality, given that it is a fairly simple project that runs on terminal, also it doesn't require perfomance at all.
- Another tool that I could exercise a lot was [Git](https://git-scm.com/), one of my requirements for this project was to make use of this version control manager in the proper way (at least in basic things, like committing my changes), and I think I've had a good improvement.
